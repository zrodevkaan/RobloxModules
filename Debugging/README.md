LuaSnooper - Never Use print for Debugging Again
================================================

LuaSnooper is a debugging tool for Roblox LuaU. It allows you to easily track changes to your Lua code by logging the values of local variables and any changes to them (returned).

You want to know which lines are running and which aren't, and what the values of the local variables are.

Usage
-----

1.  Download the `LuaSnooper.lua` file from the GitHub repository and copy it to your project directory.
    
2.  In your Lua code, import the `LuaSnooper` module by including the following line at the beginning of your file:
    
    luaCopy code
    
    `local LuaSnooper = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):FindFirstChild("LuaSnooper"))`
    
3.  To use the `Trace` function to trace a specific function in your code, call `Trace` with the function as its argument. For example:
    
    luaCopy code
    
    `function myFunction(arg1, arg2)     -- Code! end  local tracedFunction = LuaSnooper.Trace(myFunction)`
    
4.  The `tracedFunction` variable now holds a new function that you can call instead of `myFunction`. When `tracedFunction` is called, it will print out information about the function call, including the values of any arguments and changes to local variables.
    

Example
-------

Here's an example of how to use LuaSnooper to track changes to a Lua function:

luaCopy code

`local LuaSnooper = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):FindFirstChild("LuaSnooper"))  function myFunction(arg1, arg2)     local myVar = arg1 + arg2     myVar = myVar + 1     return myVar end  local tracedFunction = LuaSnooper.Trace(myFunction)  tracedFunction(5, 10)`

When you run this code, you should see output similar to the following:

javascriptCopy code

`Function: myFunction   Arguments: 5, 10 Exiting: myFunction    Returned: 16 Variable 'myVar' changed to '16'`
